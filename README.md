## Description

In this project, I designed a single-page **library app** that allows you to create a card for your book and keep it in the library area. In cards, you can write book name, author name, pages of book, read status, and remove book cards. ***The main goal of this project was to learn the concept of objects in JS***. This project UI is known as [Neo Brutalism](https://dribbble.com/tags/neo_brutalism).
